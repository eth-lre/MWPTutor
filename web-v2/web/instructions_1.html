The task is to annotate teacher moves for a specific sentence in math tutoring dialogues.
It is a one-to-one conversation where the teacher is guiding a 6th-grade student to solve a math word problem.

<ul style="padding-left: 5px;">
    <li>
        <b>Q1. Did the student get to the final correct answer?</b>
        <br>
        If yes, mark the utterance where the student first states the correct final answer as "Correct". Only consider the answer that the tutor acknowledges as being correct. Even if the student is simply repeating an answer the tutor gave out, say yes if it is correct.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Q2. Did the tutor explicitly reveal the final answer before the student having figured it out?</b>
        <br>
        If yes, mark the utterance where the tutor gave out the answer as "Reveal". Do not say yes unless the tutor gives away the actual verbatim answer, even if he gives out clues that could make the answer obvious. 
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Q3. Was the student's correct answer obtained by a wrong method, e.g. two errors cancelling out?</b>
        <br>
        Pick the appropriate option at the bottom of the conversation.
    </li>
</ul>

If the tutor reveals the answer, and the student repeats it after, mark both utterances appropriately.
