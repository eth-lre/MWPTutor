The task is to annotate teacher moves for a specific sentence in math tutoring dialogues.
It is a one-to-one conversation where the teacher is guiding a 6th-grade student to solve a math word problem.

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Did the student get to the final correct answer?</b>
        <br>
        Only consider the answer that the tutor acknowledges as being correct. Even if the student is simply repeating an answer the tutor gave out, say yes if it is correct.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Is it possible that the correct answer was obtained by a wrong method, eg two errors cancelling out?</b>
        <br>
        Do not consider any step that the tutor would disagree with or misses.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Did the tutor explicitly reveal the final answer before the student having figured it out?</b>
        <br>
        Do not say yes unless the tutor gives away the actual verbatim answer, even if he gives out any clues that could make the answer obvious.
    </li>
</ul>
