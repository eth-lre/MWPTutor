The task is to annotate teacher moves for a specific sentence in math tutoring dialogues.
It is a one-to-one conversation where the teacher is guiding a 6th-grade student to solve a math word problem.

The criteria are:
<h4>Grammatical:</h4>
The hint is linguistically and grammatically correct.
            
<h4>Specific:</h4>
The hint is specific to the step, and not just a vague lead-on statement.
            
<h4>Helpful:</h4>
The hint can potentially help the student make progress in the current step, given the previous student's utterance.
            
<h4>Not revealing:</h4>
The hint does not reveal the final answer for the step.
