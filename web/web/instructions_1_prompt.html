The task is to annotate teacher moves for a specific sentence in math tutoring dialogues.
It is a one-to-one conversation where the teacher is guiding a 6th-grade student to solve a math word problem.

The criteria are:
<h4>Grammatical:</h4>
The prompt is linguistically and grammatically correct and is a question. For this question do not consider the practicality of the question or whether or not it relates to the provided solution step. Only consider the prompt utterance. Answer "no" if the prompt is not a question, or a question that does not admit a numerical answer.
            
<h4>Relevant:</h4>
The prompt clearly addresses the step, ie, the only way to correctly answer the question is to complete the current step. For this question, only consider whether or not the prompt makes sense given the solution step, independent of the previous utterances in the conversation.

<h4>Not redundant:</h4>
The prompt is not redundant to what the student already said in the previous step ie it makes sense to ask this question after the previous response. Answer no only if the student already suggested that they follow the path suggested by the prompt in their previous utterance.

<h4>Not revealing:</h4>
The prompt does not reveal the exact operation to be carried out. The "answer" of the step is the RHS of the equation(marked in &lt&lt-&gt&gt) within the "Current Step". The "operation" is whatever mathematical operators were used in the LHS.
