The task is to annotate teacher moves for a specific sentence in math tutoring dialogues.
It is a one-to-one conversation where the teacher is guiding a 6th-grade student to solve a math word problem.

A good hint (as opposed to a prompt) tells the student exactly what to do, but does not reveal the answer. it should be more direct than the prompt(preceding tutor utterrance) The criteria are:
<h4>Grammatical:</h4>
The hint is linguistically and grammatically correct. For this question do not consider the truthfullness of the hint or whether or not it agrees with the provided solution step. Only consider the hint utterance.
            
<h4>Specific:</h4>
The hint is specific to the step, and not just a vague lead-on statement. For this question, only consider whether or not the hint makes sense given the solution step, independent of the previous utterances in the conversation eg, if the hint provides <b>correct</b> information about the step, but it is not something a tutor would say at this point(perhaps because the students confusion is of a different nature) you should still answer yes to this part. 
            
<h4>Helpful:</h4>
The hint can potentially help the student make progress in the current step, given the previous student's utterance. For this part do not take into account the solution step, only judge if the hint provides some information that might help a student make progress(whether that be in the right direction or the wrong direction)
            
<h4>Not revealing:</h4>
The hint does not reveal the final answer for the step. The "answer" of the step is the RHS of the equation(marked in &lt&lt-&gt&gt) within the "Current Step".
